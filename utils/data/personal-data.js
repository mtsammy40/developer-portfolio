  description: "I'm Samuel Mutemi, a Full-Stack Developer with over a half a decade of turning coffee into clean code. JavaScript is my native language (including its weird dialects - I've made peace with 'undefined' and 'NaN'). I've built everything from lightning-fast React applications to bulletproof Node.js APIs, with battle-tested experience across the entire web stack. My superpower? Taking complex problems and turning them into elegant solutions. When I'm not debating tabs vs spaces or rescuing legacy jQuery codebases, I'm mentoring junior developers (someone has to warn them about dependency hell).I approach every project with three principles: (1) Performance matters, (2) Maintainability isn't optional. Currently available for challenging projects where my mix of technical depth and hard-won experience can make an impact. Let's build something remarkable together - or at least debug it until it works.",
